# Amazon-Product--Hunting-Method-Seller-Snipping-

Overview
This project is focused on automating the Amazon Product Hunting process using the Seller Sniping Method. The Seller Sniping Method is an effective product research technique that allows users to manually search for products and explore what other sellers are offering. In this project, we have automated this process by leveraging Selenium to search for a brand name, identify products linked to various sellers, and delve into their storefronts to uncover what products they are selling.

Project Objectives
Automate the process of Amazon product hunting through seller sniping.
Extract key product details such as product titles, brands, reviews, ratings, estimated sales, price, ASIN, and Best Sellers Rank (BSR).
Build a pipeline to navigate to different product links and extract relevant data efficiently.

What is the Seller Sniping Method?
The Seller Sniping Method is a product research strategy commonly used in e-commerce, particularly for finding profitable products to sell. It involves:

Manual Search: Finding a potential product and reviewing the details.
Seller Analysis: Checking which sellers are offering that product.
Storefront Exploration: Visiting the sellers' storefronts to identify other products they are selling and analyzing their potential profitability.
This project automates these steps, bypassing the need for manual product research and making the process faster and more efficient.

Features of This Project
Automated Navigation: Uses Selenium to automate navigation across product pages and seller storefronts.
Data Extraction: Collects and compiles product information, including:
Product Title
Brand Name
Review Counts
Ratings
Estimated Sales
Price
ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number)
BSR (Best Sellers Rank)
Data Storage: Saves the collected data into a pandas DataFrame.
